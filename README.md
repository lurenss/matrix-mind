## What is this?
Ever thought of just asking your CSV file about its data? Matrix Mind, an innovative application powered by Large Language Model (LLM), allows you to do just that. 
It is an alternative and more human oriented way to interact with data by letting us engage in a conversational dialogue with our CSV files, extracting valuable insights as naturally as having a chat over coffee ☕.


Why use it:
- 🐋 100% [dockerized](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- 👨‍💻 Chat with your CSV files


How to use it:
1) Clone the repo
2) On the terminal run: docker-compose up
3)  Got to http://localhost:8080/
4)  Insert your OpenAi API KEY
5)  Upload your csv file
6)  Chat
